#BasicBlog: A Basic Multi-User Blog

Basic blog is a bare bones multi-user blog system that allows authenticated users to
write blog posts, like the blog posts of others, and comment on blog posts.

**Requirements:

BasicBlog is designed for use with Google App Engine, and running the project in a
development environment requires having the GAE SDK for python installed locally
(https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/download).

The project is also designed to work with Python 2.7 and the setup.py script uses
PIP. While running the setup script in a virtual environment is not required, it is
highly recommended.





make virtual env:
add2virtualenv (base project directory)
add2virtualenv (~/google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine/)
add2virtualenv (~/google-cloud-sdk/platform/google_appengine/lib/yaml/lib)
